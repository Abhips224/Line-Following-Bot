# Line-Following Bot
A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot that follows a visual line embedded on the floor. The line is typically a black line on a white surface or vice versa. This robot detects the line using sensors and moves accordingly to stay on the path.

Hardware Component
Microcontroller	Arduino Uno / Nano / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi Pico
IR Sensor Module (x2 or x3)	To detect the black line against white surface
Motor Driver (L298N/L293D)	To control the motors via microcontroller signals
DC Motors (x2)	To move the robot forward and take turns
Chassis/Robot Frame	Holds all components together
Wheels (x2) + Castor	For mobility
Power Source	9V Battery / Li-ion battery pack
Connecting Wires	For wiring and power connections



Working Principle
1)IR Sensors detect the reflected light. Black surfaces absorb more light (low reflection), while white surfaces reflect more (high reflection).
2)The microcontroller receives digital or analog signals from the sensors.
3)Depending on sensor input:
                         1)If the robot is centered on the line, it moves forward.
                         2)If it drifts left or right, the microcontroller adjusts the motor speeds to steer back.
4)The motor driver translates microcontroller signals into power for motors.

Circuit Design
1)R Sensors: Connected to analog or digital pins of Arduino (e.g., A0, A1, A2).
2)Motor Driver Inputs:
                    IN1, IN2 control Motor A.
                    IN3, IN4 control Motor B.
3)Motor Driver Output:
                    Out1, Out2 to left motor.
                    Out3, Out4 to right motor.
4)Power Connections:
                    Arduino powered by battery (Vin).
                    Motor driver powered by battery (~9V) and GND shared with Arduino.

Future Enhancements

1)Add PID control for smoother following.
2)Use 3 or 5 sensors for better accuracy.
3)Include Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for remote control override.
4)Add obstacle avoidance sensors for complex navigation.
